PyRTL Research
=====

The research directory is for project specific code which we would like to keep separate from
"core" functionality.  Code in this directory should not be released with the rest of PyRTL to the
general public, but will be shared among the lab.  

Code should be contained in its own subdirectory, and if changes to core functions are required, 
it is advised that one do this through superclasses rather than modifications to the core if possible.
