#  Numbering scheme for links is as follows
#  Each horizontal link (dir = 0):
#     is indexed by the same cordinates as the router to its left
#     if numbered 0 if it goes to the right
#     if numbered 1 if it goes to the left
#  Each vertical link (dir = 1):
#     is indexed by the same cordinates as the router underneath it
#     if numbered 0 if it goes up
#     if numbered 1 if it goes down
#  Each local link (dir = 2, not shown):
#     is indexed by the same cordinates as the router it connects to
#     if numbered 0 if to goes into the router (from the processor node)
#     if numbered 1 if it goes out of the router (into the processor node)
#
#  Full link "address" is (x, y, dir, number)
